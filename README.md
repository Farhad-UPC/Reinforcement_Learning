# Reinforcement_Learning
Reinforcement learning is an area of machine learning concerned with how software agents ought to take actions in an environment so as to maximize some notion of cumulative reward


# Epsilon-Greedy algorithm
To get you started thinking algorithmically about the Explore-Exploit dilemma, you should leran how to code up one of the simplest possible algorithms for trading off exploration and exploitation. This algorithm is called the epsilon-Greedy algorithm. In computer science, a greedy algorithm is an algorithm that always takes whatever action seems best at the present moment, even when that decision might lead to bad long term consequences. The epsilon-Greedy algorithm is almost a greedy algorithm because it generally exploits the best available option, but every once in a while the epsilon-Greedy algorithm explores the other available options. As we’ll see, the term epsilon in the algorithm’s name refers to the odds that the algorithm explores instead of exploiting [Bandit Algorithms for Website Optimization by John Myles White].
